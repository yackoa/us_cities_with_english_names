# The Hypothesis

`“Since the UK was one of the main countries that colonised the USA, and the UK is on the east side of the USA there are more towns/cities with UK names on the east coast of the US rather than the west coast”`

## Data

## Analysis
I have tried to analyze this hypothesis, please find the complete analysis in this [notebook](https://github.com/yackoa/us_cities_with_english_names/blob/master/thoughts.ipynb)

(Please download the [notebook](https://github.com/yackoa/us_cities_with_english_names/blob/master/thoughts.ipynb) file and view it using jupyter. The reason being, there is a cool infographic GIF which doesn't play on github)

Alternatively if you don't have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or [ipython](https://ipython.org/) you can download the [HTML version](https://github.com/yackoa/us_cities_with_english_names/blob/master/thoughts.html) and view it on any browser. ( No guarantees on IE  :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: )
